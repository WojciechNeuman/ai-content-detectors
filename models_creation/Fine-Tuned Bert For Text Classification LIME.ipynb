The controversy was sparked by an article in the August 26, 2010 issue of Nature titled \\u201cThe Evolution of Eusociality.\\u201d Written by Harvard mathematicians and biologist, the paper challenged inclusive fitness theory, which expanded Darwin\\u2019s definition of \\u201cfitness\\u201d to include the genes of an organism\\u2019s relatives. Inclusive fitness theory has been a cornerstone in evolutionary biology for the past 50 years, and the paper in Nature claimed that mathematical models based on standard natural selection theory provide a \\u201csimpler and superior approach.\\u201d\\n\\nThis disagreement among evolutionary biologists stirred up a debate that is yet to be resolved. In the March 31, 2015 issue of PLOS Biology, evolutionary biologist, David C. Queller, co-authored a paper called \\u201cRelatedness, Conflict and the Evolution of Eusociality\\u201d with Stephen Rong and Xiaoyun Liao. Queller suggests a solution to the impasse by proposing a way to test the Harvard mathematicians\\u2019 alternative model to inclusive fitness theory. The results led Queller to claim that the mathematical models are essentially equivalent in that they ultimately predict the same results.\\n\\nInclusive fitness theory was developed to explain eusociality, which is an extreme form of altruism found in social insects where non-reproducing colony members give up their right to reproduce and devote their lives to caring for the offspring of a single reproducing member. Hamilton\\u2019s inclusive fitness theory was invented to solve this paradox. However, the Harvard authors claimed that almost none of the progress in empirical research on eusocial organisms had been stimulated or advanced by inclusive fitness theory. \\n\\nQueller was puzzled by some of the assertions made in the Harvard authors\\u2019 paper and listed three claims they made. Queller then used the model presented by the authors to test whether these claims were true. The first claim tested was that relatedness plays no role in eusociality. Queller found that varying relatedness in the model takes us back to what we thought we already knew from inclusive fitness theory. The second claim was that the queen and her workers are not in conflict, but Queller found that the mathematics shows that they're not robots, and there exist regions of conflict where the queen would like her workers to stay but the workers want to leave. The third and last claim tested was that their model showed how difficult it was for a solitary species to evolve to become eusocial. Queller found that modifying either the fitness function in their model or the worker decision rule made it easier to achieve eusociality. \\n\\nQueller hopes that his assertion that the dueling models are essentially equivalent will help resolve the debate surrounding selflessness in biology.\",\n          \"PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. -- Teflon. Linoleum. Ice. A dance floor. Those were just some of the words used when players were asked about TPC Sawgrass\\u2019 greens during Saturday\\u2019s third round of the Players. Ernie Els put it another way. \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to see some swears,\\u201d he said. To that end, one player in a text message did use a certain four-letter synonym for poop. After Jason Day set the 36-hole scoring record by reaching 15 under on a soft and pristine Stadium Course, the birdies dried up in Saturday\\u2019s hot sun and breezy conditions. The only moving done was mostly backwards. Rory McIlroy said it felt like a U.S. Open, Kevin Chappell called the greens dead and bald, and Keegan Bradley spoke for some who claimed the speeds of the putting surfaces bordered on the edge of out of control. The result: Some eye-popping numbers and not much fun for anyone, unless you\\u2019re a fan of car crashes. Over the first two days, there were 122 combined three-putts among the 144 players in the field. On Saturday there were 149 three-putts among the 76 players who made the cut, and 15 of those players had at least 34 putts for their round including McIlroy, who had 37. Sixty players had at least one double bogey or worse, with the field making a total of 86 double bogeys or higher and 38 players posting nine-hole totals of 40 or higher. The third-round scoring average was a whopping 75.59, more than three strokes over par and more than four strokes higher than that of each of the first two days, and seven players failed to break 80. Only six players broke par including Ken Duke, who somehow shot 65 in what one player called easily the round of the year.\\n\\nDid the PGA Tour, trying to address critics who felt conditions during the first two rounds were too easy for an event of this caliber, over-correct? Perhaps, although that wasn\\u2019t the intention. \\u201cWhat happened today was just kind of a perfect storm with the weather,\\u201d said Mark Russell, PGA Tour vice president of rules. \\u201cWe weren\\u2019t expecting a 20 mile-an-hour wind all day, and the humidity 30 percent, not a cloud in the sky. And they just, you know, sped up on us.\\u201d The result was putt after putt getting away from the players. Sergio Garcia had a five-putt on the fifth hole. Actually, a six-putt if you include his attempt from the fringe.\\n\\nRELATED: Watch Sergio's Putting Woes McIlroy putted his ball off the green on the second hole.\\n\\n\\u201cIt got to the point where when you\\u2019re grounding your putter, you can\\u2019t square it up because the surfaces are so shiny and so slippery,\\u201d McIlroy said after posting a 75. \\u201cTo have such a drastic speed change in the greens from when we played [Friday] to today, I just found I had a really difficult time to adjust to them. \\u201cThat was borderline unfair on a few holes,\\u201d McIlroy continued. \\u201cA few pin positions were on crowns, and you dribble a putt by, all of a sudden it\\u2019s six feet by.\\u201d The sixth and 15th holes were the most treacherous with 14 three-putts on each, tied for most on the course. It wasn\\u2019t just the weather drying out and speeding up the greens, either. Nearly every hole location was five paces or less from the edge of the green. The only one that wasn\\u2019t was the 18th. It was six paces from the edge. Officials also double cut, double-rolled and single-rolled the greens between the second and third rounds. \\u201cThe ball almost seems to glide on these greens without really rolling,\\u201d said Justin Rose, who had three double bogeys on the back nine alone and shot 42 in that stretch en route to a 78. \\u201cI was really surprised to see it change so quick.\\u201d Even those who played well struggled to wrap their head around what they were experiencing. Jason Day, who despite two double bogeys shot 73 and leads by four going into the final round, said the greens were \\u201ccrazy\\u201d and the front nine \\u201cborderline.\\u201d\\n\\nWhat does it mean for Sunday\\u2019s final round? Officials said they don\\u2019t plan to do anything more to the greens. \\u201cIt\\u2019ll be interesting to see where they go now,\\u201d Rose said of the putting surfaces, which will be ripped up and replaced beginning on Monday. \\u201cDo they let them go and make it tough, tough, tough, or do they back it up and have a little more exciting Sunday where you can make some birdies and it\\u2019s a little more fun?\\u201d\\n\\nWATCH: GOLF DIGEST VIDEOS\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":7}],"source":["df_train"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"metadata":{"id":"R9cH61sKXNzv","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1737636628512,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Wojciech Neuman","userId":"02532032841570570568"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["def text_process(mess):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Process text to:\n","    1.
